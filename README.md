## Description

This is a sample Python project structure created using a script. The project includes basic files and directories to get you started with developing your Python application.

## Project Structure

my_project/
├── my_project/
│ ├── init.py
│ ├── main.py
│ ├── module1.py
│ └── module2.py

├── setup.py
├── README.md


### Files and Directories

- **my_project/**: Contains the main package of the project.
  - **\_\_init\_\_.py**: Initializes the `my_project` package.
  - **main.py**: The main entry point of the application. Contains a `main` function that prints "Hello, World!".
  - **module1.py**: Contains a sample function `function1` that returns a string.
  - **module2.py**: Contains a sample function `function2` that returns a string.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the project dependencies. Currently empty.
- **setup.py**: Script for setting up the project and its dependencies. It also sets up a console script entry point for the main function.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage, etc.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rassie01/PythonDefaultTemp.git
   cd my_project

## Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

## Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To run the main script, use the following command:

python -m my_project.main
This will execute the main function in main.py and print "Hello, World!".

Running Tests
To run tests (if you add any), you can use the unittest framework. Here's an example command to discover and run all tests in the tests directory:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover tests
